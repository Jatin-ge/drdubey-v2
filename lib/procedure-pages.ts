    intro: 'Dr. Dheeraj Dubay offers robotic-assisted knee replacement surgery at Shalby Hospital, Jaipur — one of the most advanced orthopaedic procedures available in Rajasthan.

      heading: 'What is Robotic Knee Replacement Surgery?',
      content: "Robotic knee replacement is a cutting-edge surgical technique where a robotic arm assists the surgeon in performing the procedure with extraordinary precision. Before the surgery, a detailed 3D model of the patient's knee is created using CT scan data. The robotic system uses this model to create a personalised surgical plan specific to that patient's anatomy. During surgery, the robotic arm guides Dr. Dubay's movements to within a fraction of a millimetre, ensuring the implant is positioned exactly as planned. This level of precision is simply not achievable by hand alone, no matter how experienced the surgeon. The robot does not perform the surgery independently — Dr. Dubay is in complete control throughout. The robotic system acts as an intelligent assistant that prevents any movement outside the pre-planned boundaries, protecting the surrounding healthy tissue and ligaments from unnecessary damage. This results in a knee that feels more natural, lasts longer, and allows patients to return to activity faster than with traditional surgery.",

The robotic system is an advanced tool that assists him — similar to how GPS assists a skilled driver. The robot cannot operate independently. Dr. Dubay makes all surgical decisions; the robot helps execute them with extraordinary precision." },

      { q: 'Is robotic knee replacement covered by insurance?', a: "Most health insurance policies cover knee replacement surgery. Whether robotic specifically is covered depends on your individual policy. Dr. Dubay's team assists with all insurance paperwork and TPA pre-authorisation. Call +91-8955373205 for insurance-related queries." },
      { q: 'How long does a robotic knee implant last?', a: 'Robotic knee implants, being more precisely placed, experience more even wear over time. Modern implants placed with robotic assistance are designed to last 20-25 years or more with appropriate care and physiotherapy.' },
      { q: 'What is the difference between robotic and computer navigation surgery?', a: 'Computer navigation uses sensors and a computer to guide the surgeon but does not involve a robotic arm. Robotic surgery uses an actual robotic arm that physically assists and constrains movement within planned boundaries. Both are superior to traditional surgery; robotic surgery is generally considered more advanced.' },
      { q: 'Can both knees be replaced robotically at the same time?', a: "Yes, bilateral robotic knee replacement (both knees at once) is possible for suitable patients. Dr. Dubay evaluates each patient's overall health, cardiac function, and fitness before recommending bilateral surgery. It has the advantage of a single recovery period." },

The surgery addresses the three compartments of the knee — the inner side (medial), outer side (lateral), and the kneecap (patella). The artificial components replicate the natural curves and movements of the knee, eliminating the bone-on-bone contact that causes severe pain in advanced arthritis.

      { q: 'Is knee replacement surgery painful?', a: 'Modern pain management means most patients experience much less discomfort than expected. A combination of nerve blocks, spinal anaesthesia, oral medications, and physiotherapy techniques keeps pain well controlled. Most patients describe the experience as far more comfortable than they anticipated.' },

      { q: 'Is hip replacement safe for elderly patients?', a: "Hip replacement is routinely and successfully performed in patients in their 70s, 80s, and even 90s. A thorough pre-operative assessment ensures surgery is safe for each individual. For elderly patients with hip fractures, hip replacement often gives faster mobilisation and better outcomes than fracture fixation." },
      { q: 'How do I know if I need hip or knee replacement?', a: "Dr. Dubay evaluates the location and nature of your pain carefully. Hip joint pain typically radiates to the groin, inner thigh, or buttock. Knee pain is more localised around the knee. An X-ray and clinical examination by Dr. Dubay will confirm which joint requires treatment." },

This allows adjustments to be made during surgery rather than after, ensuring the final implant position is optimal for that specific patient's anatomy. Studies consistently show that computer navigation improves implant alignment accuracy from approximately 70-75% (with traditional surgery) to over 95%. Better alignment means more natural knee movement, more even wear on the implant surfaces, and potentially longer implant life.",

The Zero technique combines multimodal pain management (using several different pain-control methods simultaneously to minimise opioid use), precise surgical technique that minimises tissue disruption, pre-operative patient preparation including exercises and education, and an aggressive but carefully supervised physiotherapy protocol beginning within hours of surgery. The result is patients who walk on day one, go home in 3 days, and return to independence far faster than with traditional approaches.",

      heading: 'What is Revision Knee Replacement?',
      content: 'Revision knee replacement removes the original implant components and replaces them with new ones — often larger, more complex components that can compensate for bone loss that has occurred since the original surgery. The procedure is required when a knee replacement fails due to implant wear (the plastic spacer wearing thin after many years), loosening of the implant from the bone, infection around the implant, instability (the knee feels loose or gives way), stiffness preventing normal movement, or fracture around the implant. Revision surgery is considerably more complex than primary replacement because the original implants must be carefully removed without causing further bone damage, and there is typically less bone available to anchor the new components. This requires specialised revision implant systems with stems, sleeves, and wedges that compensate for bone loss. An experienced surgeon with specific revision expertise is essential for the best outcome.',

After one knee is replaced, the surgical team repositions the patient and replaces the second knee in the same operation. The combined procedure typically takes 2-3 hours. The primary advantage is a single recovery period — rather than recovering from one knee replacement and then facing a second operation 6-12 months later, bilateral replacement means one period of recovery, one set of physiotherapy, and a faster return to full bilateral function. The approach requires careful patient selection — the patient must be medically fit enough to undergo the longer combined procedure. Blood loss, although greater than for a single knee, is managed carefully with modern blood conservation techniques. Studies show that appropriately selected patients undergoing simultaneous bilateral replacement have outcomes equivalent to staged bilateral replacement with the advantage of a single recovery.",
